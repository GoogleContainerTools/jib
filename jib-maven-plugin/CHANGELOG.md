All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 3.1.2

### Fixed

- Fixed the bug introduced in 3.1 that constructs a wrong Java runtime classpath when two dependencies have the same artifact ID and version but different group IDs. The bug occurs only when using Java 9+ or setting `<container><expandClasspathDependencies>`. ([#3331](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3331))

## 3.1.1

### Fixed

- Fixed the regression introduced in 3.1.0 where a build may fail due to an error from main class inference even if `<container><entrypoint>` is configured. ([#3295](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3295))

## 3.1.0

### Added

- For Google Artifact Registry (`*-docker.pkg.dev`), Jib now tries [Google Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) last like it has been doing for `gcr.io`. ([#3241](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3241))

### Changed

- Jib now creates an additional layer that contains two small text files: [`/app/jib-classpath-file` and `/app/jib-main-class-file`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin/README.md#custom-container-entrypoint). They hold, respectively, the final Java runtime classpath and the main class computed by Jib that are suitable for app execution on JVM. For example, with Java 9+, setting the container entrypoint to `java --class-path @/app/jib-classpath-file @/app/jib-main-class-file` will work to start the app. (This is basically the default entrypoint set by Jib when the entrypoint is not explicitly configured by the user.) The files are always generated whether Java 8 or 9+, or whether `jib.container.entrypoint` is explicitly configured. The files can be helpful especially when setting a custom entrypoint for a shell script that needs to get the classpath and the main class computed by Jib, or for [AppCDS](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2471). ([#3280](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3280))
- For Java 9+ apps, the default Java runtime classpath explicitly lists all the app dependencies, preserving the dependency loading order declared by Maven. This is done by changing the default entrypoint to use the new classpath JVM argument file (basically `java -cp @/app/jib-classpath-file`). As such, `<container><expandClasspathDependencies>` takes no effect for Java 9+. ([#3280](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3280))
- Timestamps of file entries in a tarball built with `jib:buildTar` are set to the epoch, making the tarball reproducible. ([#3158](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3158))

## 3.0.0

### Added

- New `<includes>` and `<excludes>` options for `<extraDirectories>`. This enables copying a subset of files from the source directory using glob patterns. ([#2564](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2564))
- [Jib extensions](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib-extensions) can be loaded via the [Maven dependency injection mechanism](https://maven.apache.org/maven-jsr330.html). This also enables injecting arbitrary dependencies (for example, Maven components) into an extension. ([#3036](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3036))

### Changed

- [Switched the default base images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/docs/default_base_image.md) from Distroless to [`adoptopenjdk:{8,11}-jre`](https://hub.docker.com/_/adoptopenjdk) and [`jetty`](https://hub.docker.com/_/jetty) (for WAR). ([#3124](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3124))

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where some log messages used color in the "plain" console output. ([#2764](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2764))

## 2.8.0

### Added

- Added support for [configuring registry mirrors](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/docs/faq.md#i-am-hitting-docker-hub-rate-limits-how-can-i-configure-registry-mirrors) for base images. This is useful when hitting [Docker Hub rate limits](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits). Only public mirrors (such as `mirror.gcr.io`) are supported. ([#3011](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3011))

### Changed

- Build will fail if Jib cannot create or read the [global Jib configuration file](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin#global-jib-configuration). ([#2996](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2996))

## 2.7.1

### Fixed

- Updated jackson dependency version causing compatibility issues. ([#2931](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2931))

## 2.7.0

### Changed

- Added an option `<container><expandClasspathDependencies>` to preserve the order of loading dependencies as configured in a project. The option enumerates dependency JARs instead of using a wildcard (`/app/libs/*`) in the Java runtime classpath for an image entrypoint. ([#1871](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1871), [#1907](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1907), [#2228](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2228), [#2733](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2733))
    - The option is also useful for AppCDS. ([#2471](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2471))
    - Turning on the option may result in a very long classpath string, and the OS may not support passing such a long string to JVM.

### Fixed

- Fixed `NullPointerException` when pulling an OCI base image whose manifest does not have `mediaType` information. ([#2819](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2819))
- Fixed build failure when using a Docker daemon base image (`docker://...`) that has duplicate layers. ([#2829](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2829))

## 2.6.0

### Added

### Changed

- Previous locally cached base image manifests will be ignored, as the caching mechanism changed to enable multi-platform image building. ([#2730](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2730), [#2711](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2711))
- Upgraded the ASM library to 9.0 to resolve an issue when auto-inferring main class in Java 15+. ([#2776](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2776))
- _Incubating feature_: can now configure multiple platforms (such as architectures) to build multiple images as a bundle and push as a manifest list (also known as a fat manifest). As an incubating feature, there are certain limitations. For example, OCI image indices are not supported, and building a manifest list is supported only for registry pushing (the `jib:build` goal). ([#2523](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2523))
    ```xml
      <from>
        <image>... image reference to a manifest list ...</image>
        <platforms>
          <platform>
            <architecture>arm64</architecture>
            <os>linux</os>
          </platform>
        </platforms>
      </from>
   ```

### Fixed

- Fixed authentication failure with Azure Container Registry when using ["tokens"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-repository-scoped-permissions). ([#2784](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2784))
- Improved authentication flow for base image registry. ([#2134](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2134))

## 2.5.2

### Fixed

- Fixed the regression introduced in 2.5.1 that caused Jib to containerize a Spring Boot fat JAR instead of a normal thin JAR when `<containerizingMode>packaged` is set and the Spring Boot Maven plugin does not have a `<configuration>` block. ([#2693](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2693))

## 2.5.1

### Fixed

- Fixed `NullPointerException` when `<containerizingMode>packaged` is set the Spring Boot Maven plugin does not have a `<configuration>` block. ([#2687](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2687))

## 2.5.0

### Added

- Also tries `.exe` file extension for credential helpers on Windows. ([#2527](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2527))
- New system property `jib.skipExistingImages` (false by default) to skip pushing images (manifests) if the image already exists in the registry. ([#2360](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2360))
- _Incubating feature_: can now configure desired platform (architecture and OS) to select the matching manifest from a Docker manifest list for a base image. Currently supports building only one image. OCI image indices are not supported. ([#1567](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1567))
    ```xml
      <from>
        <image>... image reference to a manifest list ...</image>
        <platforms>
          <platform>
            <architecture>arm64</architecture>
            <os>linux</os>
          </platform>
        </platforms>
      </from>
    ```

### Fixed

- Fixed reporting a wrong credential helper name when the helper does not exist on Windows. ([#2527](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2527))
- Fixed `NullPointerException` when the `"auths":` section in `~/.docker/config.json` has an entry with no `"auth":` field. ([#2535](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2535))
- Fixed `NullPointerException` to return a helpful message when a server does not provide any message in certain error cases (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, and 405 Method Not Allowed). ([#2532](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2532))
- Now supports sending client certificate (for example, via the `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` and `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword` system properties) and thus enabling mutual TLS authentication. ([#2585](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2585), [#2226](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2226))
- Fixed build failure with `<containerizingMode>packaged` in Spring Boot projects where Jib assumed a wrong JAR path when `<finalName>` or `<classifier>` is configured in Spring Boot. ([#2565](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2565))
- Fixed an issue where Jib cannot infer Kotlin main class that takes no arguments. ([#2666](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2666))

## 2.4.0

### Added

- Jib Extension Framework! The framework enables anyone to easily extend and tailor the Jib Maven plugin behavior to their liking. Check out the new [Jib Extensions](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib-extensions) GitHub repository to learn more. ([#2401](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2401))
- Project dependencies in a multi-module WAR project are now stored in a separate "project dependencies" layer (as currently done for a non-WAR project). ([#2450](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2450))

### Changed

- Previous locally cached application layers (`<project root>/target/jib-cache`) will be ignored because of changes to the caching selectors. ([#2499](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2499))

### Fixed

- Fixed authentication failure with Azure Container Registry when using an identity token defined in the `auths` section of Docker config (`~/.docker/config.json`). ([#2488](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2488))

## 2.3.0

### Added

- `<from>` and `<into>` fields to `<extraDirectories><paths><path>` for configuring the source and target of an extra directory. ([#1581](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1581))

### Fixed

- Fixed the problem not inheriting `USER` container configuration from a base image. ([#2421](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2421))
- Fixed wrong capitalization of JSON properties in a loadable Docker manifest when building a tar image. ([#2430](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2430))
- Fixed an issue when using a base image whose image creation timestamp contains timezone offset. ([#2428](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2428))
- Fixed an issue inferring a wrong main class or using an invalid main class (for example, Spring Boot project containing multiple main classes). ([#2456](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2456))

## 2.2.0

### Added

- Glob pattern support for `<extraDirectories><permissions>`. ([#1200](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1200))
- Support for image references with both a tag and a digest. ([#1481](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1481))
- The `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable specifying the directory containing docker configs is now checked during credential retrieval. ([#1618](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1618))
- Also tries `.cmd` file extension for credential helpers on Windows. ([#2399](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2399))

### Changed

- `<container><creationTime>` now accepts more timezone formats:`+HHmm`. This allows for easier configuration of creationTime by external systems. ([#2320](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2320))

## 2.1.0

### Added

- Additionally reads credentials from `~/.docker/.dockerconfigjson` and legacy Docker config (`~/.docker/.dockercfg`). Also searches for `$HOME/.docker/*` (in addition to current `System.get("user.home")/.docker/*`). This may help retrieve credentials, for example, on Kubernetes. ([#2260](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2260))
- New skaffold configuration options that modify how jib's build config is presented to skaffold ([#2292](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2292)):
    - `<watch><buildIncludes>`: a list of build files to watch
    - `<watch><includes>`: a list of project files to watch
    - `<watch><excludes>`: a list of files to exclude from watching
    - `<sync><excludes>`: a list of files to exclude from sync'ing

### Fixed

- Fixed a `skaffold init` issue with projects containing submodules specifying different parent poms. ([#2262](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2262))
- Fixed authentication failure with error `server did not return 'WWW-Authenticate: Bearer' header` in certain cases (for example, on OpenShift). ([#2258](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2258))
- Fixed an issue where using local Docker images (by `docker://...`) on Windows caused an error. ([#2270](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2270))

## 2.0.0

### Added

- Added json output file for image metadata after a build is complete. Writes to `target/jib-image.json` by default, configurable with `<outputPaths><imageJson>`. ([#2227](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2227))
- Added automatic update checks. Jib will now display a message if there is a new version of Jib available. See the [privacy page](../docs/privacy.md) for more details. ([#2193](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2193))

### Changed

- Removed deprecated `<extraDirectory>` configuration in favor of `<extraDirectories>`. ([#1691](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1691))
- Removed deprecated `<container><useCurrentTimestamp>` configuration in favor of `<container><creationTime>` with `USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. ([#1897](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1897))
- HTTP redirection URLs are no longer sanitized in order to work around an issue with certain registries that do not conform to HTTP standards. This resolves an issue with using Red Hat OpenShift and Quay registries. ([#2106](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2106), [#1986](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1986#issuecomment-547610104))
- The default base image cache location has been changed on MacOS and Windows. ([#2216](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2216))
    - MacOS (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` defined): from `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/google-cloud-tools-java/jib/` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Google/Jib/`
    - MacOS (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` not defined): from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/google-cloud-tools-java/jib/` to `$HOME/Library/Caches/Google/Jib/`
    - Windows (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` defined): from `$XDG_CACHE_HOME\google-cloud-tools-java\jib\` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME\Google\Jib\Cache\`
    - Windows (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` not defined): from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\google-cloud-tools-java\jib\` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Jib\Cache\`
    - Initial builds will be slower until the cache is repopulated, unless you manually move the cache from the old location to the new location
- When giving registry credentials in `settings.xml`, specifying port in `<server><id>` is no longer required. ([#2135](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2135))

### Fixed

- Fixed `<extraDirectories><permissions>` being ignored if `<paths>` are not explicitly defined. ([#2106](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2160))
- Now `<containerizingMode>packaged` works as intended with Spring Boot projects that generate a fat JAR. ([#2170](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2170))
- Now `<containerizingMode>packaged` correctly identifies the packaged JAR generated at a non-default location when configured with the Maven Jar Plugin's `<classifier>` and `<outputDirectory>`. ([#2170](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2170))
- `jib:buildTar` with `<container><format>OCI` now builds a correctly formatted OCI archive. ([#2124](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2124))
- Fixed an issue where configuring the `<warName>` property of the Maven WAR plugin fails the build. ([#2206](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2206))
- Now automatically refreshes Docker registry authentication tokens when expired, fixing the issue that long-running builds may fail with "401 unauthorized." ([#691](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/691))

## 1.8.0

### Changed

- Optimized building to a registry with local base images. ([#1913](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1913))

### Fixed

- Fixed reporting wrong module name when `skaffold init` is run on multi-module projects. ([#2088](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2088))
- `<allowInsecureRegistries>` and the `sendCredentialsOverHttp` system property are now effective for authentication service server connections. ([#2074](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2074))
- Fixed inefficient communications when interacting with insecure registries and servers (when `<allowInsecureRegistries>` is set). ([#946](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/946))

## 1.7.0

### Added

- `<outputPaths>` object for configuration output file locations ([#1561](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1561))
  - `<outputPaths><tar>` configures output path of `jib:buildTar` (`target/jib-image.tar` by default)
  - `<outputPaths><digest>` configures the output path of the image digest (`target/jib-image.digest` by default)
  - `<outputPaths><imageId>` configures output path of the image id  (`target/jib-image.id` by default)
- Main class inference support for Java 13/14. ([#2015](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2015))

### Changed

- Local base image layers are now processed in parallel, speeding up builds using large local base images. ([#1913](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1913))
- The base image manifest is no longer pulled from the registry if a digest is provided and the manifest is already cached. ([#1881](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1881))
- Docker daemon base images are now cached more effectively, speeding up builds using `docker://` base images. ([#1912](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1912))

### Fixed

- Fixed temporary directory cleanup during builds using local base images. ([#2016](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2016))
- Fixed additional tags being ignored when building to a tarball. ([#2043](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2043))
- Fixed `tar://` base image failing if tar does not contain explicit directory entries. ([#2067](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2067))
- Fixed an issue for WAR projects where Jib used an intermediate exploded WAR directory instead of exploding the final WAR file. ([#1091](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1091))

## 1.6.1

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with using custom base images in Java 12+ projects. ([#1995](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1995))

## 1.6.0

### Added

- Support for local base images by prefixing `<from><image>` with `docker://` to build from a docker daemon image, or `tar://` to build from a tarball image. ([#1468](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1468), [#1905](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1905))

### Changed

- To disable parallel execution, the property `jib.serialize` should be used instead of `jibSerialize`. ([#1968](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1968))
- For retrieving credentials from Docker config (`~/.docker/config.json`), `credHelpers` now takes precedence over `credsStore`, followed by `auths`. ([#1958](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1958))
- The legacy `credsStore` no longer requires defining empty registry entries in `auths` to be used. This now means that if `credsStore` is defined, `auths` will be completely ignored. ([#1958](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1958))
- `<dockerClient>` is now configurable on all goals, not just `jib:dockerBuild`. ([#1932](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1932))

### Fixed

- Fixed the regression of slow network operations introduced at 1.5.0. ([#1980](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1980))
- Fixed an issue where connection timeout sometimes fell back to attempting plain HTTP (non-HTTPS) requests when `<allowInsecureRegistries>` is set. ([#1949](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1949))

## 1.5.1

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue interacting with certain registries due to changes to URL handling in the underlying Apache HttpClient library. ([#1924](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1924))

## 1.5.0

### Added

- Can now set file timestamps (last modified time) in the image with `<container><filesModificationTime>`. The value should either be `EPOCH_PLUS_SECOND` to set the timestamps to Epoch + 1 second (default behavior), or an ISO 8601 date time parsable with [`DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html) such as `2019-07-15T10:15:30+09:00` or `2011-12-03T22:42:05Z`. ([#1818](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1818))
- Can now set container creation timestamp with `<container><creationTime>`. The value should be `EPOCH`, `USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or an ISO 8601 date time. ([#1609](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1609))
- For Google Container Registry (gcr.io), Jib now tries [Google Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) (ADC) last when no credentials can be retrieved. ADC are available on many Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments (such as Google Cloud Build, Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Google App Engine). Application Default Credentials can also be configured with `gcloud auth application-default login` locally or through the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. ([#1902](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1902))

### Changed

- When building to a registry, Jib now skips downloading and caching base image layers that already exist in the target registry. This feature will be particularly useful in CI/CD environments. However, if you want to force caching base image layers locally, set the system property `-Djib.alwaysCacheBaseImage=true`. ([#1840](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1840))
- `<container><useCurrentTimestamp>` has been deprecated in favor of `<container><creationTime>` with `USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. ([#1609](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1609))

## 1.4.0

### Added

- Can now containerize a JAR artifact instead of putting individual `.class` and resource files with `<containerizingMode>packaged`. ([#1746](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1746/files))
- Can now use `<from><image>scratch` to use the scratch (empty) base image for builds. ([#1794](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1794/files))

### Changed

- Dependencies are now split into three layers: dependencies, snapshots dependencies, project dependencies. ([#1724](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1724))

### Fixed

- Re-enabled cross-repository blob mounts. ([#1793](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1793))
- Manifest lists referenced directly by sha256 are automatically parsed and the first `linux/amd64` manifest is used. ([#1811](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1811))

## 1.3.0

### Changed

- Docker credentials (`~/.docker/config.json`) are now given priority over registry-based inferred credential helpers. ([#1704](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pulls/1704))

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where decyrpting Maven settings `settings.xml` wholesale caused the build to fail. We now decrypt only the parts that are required. ([#1709](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1709))

## 1.2.0

### Added

- Container configurations in the base image are now propagated when registry uses the old V2 image manifest, schema version 1 (such as Quay). ([#1641](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1641))
- Can now prepend paths in the container to the computed classpath with `<container><extraClasspath>`. ([#1642](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1642))
- Can now build in offline mode using `--offline`. ([#718](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/718))
- Now supports multiple extra directories with `<extraDirectories>{<paths><path>|<permissions>}`. ([#1020](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1020))

### Changed

- `<extraDirectory>(<path>|<permissions>)` are deprecated in favor of the new `<extraDirectories>{<paths><path>|<permissions>}` configurations. ([#1626](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1626))

### Fixed

- Labels in the base image are now propagated. ([#1643](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1643))
- Fixed an issue with using OCI base images. ([#1683](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1683))

## 1.1.2

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where automatically generated parent directories in a layer did not get their timestamp configured correctly to epoch + 1s. ([#1648](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1648))

## 1.1.1

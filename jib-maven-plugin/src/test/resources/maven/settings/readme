Generate settings-security.xml with, if you change this, you have to change all the files in settings.xml, so just leave it as is:

$ mvn --encrypt-master-password
Master password: <enter your password here>
{generatedValue=}
^^^ copy this password into security-settings.xml

Create settings.xml with mixed encrypted and unencrpted values, to encrypt a password value use:

$ mvn --encrypt-password -Dsettings.security=<path to security-settings.xml>
Password: <enter password here>
{generatedValue=}
^^^ copy this password into the right spot in settings.xml

# Jib - Containerize your Maven project

Jib is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) plugin for building Docker and [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) images for your Java applications.

For information about the project, see the [Jib project README](../README.md).
For the Gradle plugin, see the [jib-gradle-plugin project](../jib-gradle-plugin).

## Upcoming Features

See [Milestones](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/milestones) for planned features. [Get involved with the community](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master#get-involved-with-the-community) for the latest updates.

## Quickstart

You can containerize your application easily with one command:

```shell
mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:0.9.11:build -Dimage=<MY IMAGE>
```

This builds and pushes a container image for your application to a container registry. *If you encounter authentication issues, see [Authentication Methods](#authentication-methods).*

To build to a Docker daemon, use:

```shell
mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:0.9.11:dockerBuild
```

If you would like to set up Jib as part of your Maven build, follow the guide below.

### Setup

In your Maven Java project, add the plugin to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.9.11</version>
        <configuration>
          <to>
            <image>myimage</image>
          </to>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
```

### Configuration

Configure the plugin by setting the image to push to:

#### Using [Google Container Registry (GCR)](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)...

*Make sure you have the [`docker-credential-gcr` command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#docker_credential_helper). Jib automatically uses `docker-credential-gcr` for obtaining credentials. See [Authentication Methods](#authentication-methods) for other ways of authenticating.*

For example, to build the image `gcr.io/my-gcp-project/my-app`, the configuration would be:

```xml
<configuration>
  <to>
    <image>gcr.io/my-gcp-project/my-app</image>
  </to>
</configuration>
```

#### Using [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)...

*Make sure you have the [`docker-credential-ecr-login` command line tool](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper). Jib automatically uses `docker-credential-ecr-login` for obtaining credentials. See [Authentication Methods](#authentication-methods) for other ways of authenticating.*

For example, to build the image `aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-app`, the configuration would be:

```xml
<configuration>
  <to>
    <image>aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-app</image>
  </to>
</configuration>
```

#### Using [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/)...

*Make sure you have a [docker-credential-helper](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers#available-programs) set up. For example, on macOS, the credential helper would be `docker-credential-osxkeychain`. See [Authentication Methods](#authentication-methods) for other ways of authenticating.*

For example, to build the image `my-docker-id/my-app`, the configuration would be:

```xml
<configuration>
  <to>
    <image>registry.hub.docker.com/my-docker-id/my-app</image>
  </to>
</configuration>
```

#### *TODO: Add more examples for common registries.*

### Build your image

Build your container image with:

```shell
mvn compile jib:build
```

Subsequent builds are much faster than the initial build.

*Having trouble? Let us know by [submitting an issue](/../../issues/new), contacting us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/google/jib), or posting to the [Jib users forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jib-users).*

#### Build to Docker daemon

Jib can also build your image directly to a Docker daemon. This uses the `docker` command line tool and requires that you have `docker` available on your `PATH`.

```shell
mvn compile jib:dockerBuild
```

If you are using [`minikube`](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)'s remote Docker daemon, make sure you [set up the correct environment variables](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/reusing_the_docker_daemon.md) to point to the remote daemon:

```shell
eval $(minikube docker-env)
mvn compile jib:dockerBuild
```

#### Build an image tarball

You can build and save your image to disk as a tarball with:

```shell
mvn compile jib:buildTar
```

This builds and saves your image to `target/jib-image.tar`, which you can load into docker with:

```shell
docker load --input target/jib-image.tar
```

### Bind to a lifecycle

You can also bind `jib:build` to a Maven lifecycle, such as `package`, by adding the following execution to your `jib-maven-plugin` definition:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.google.com.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>jib-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  ...
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>build</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

Then, you can build your container image by running:

```shell
mvn package
```

### Export to a Docker context

Jib can also export a Docker context so that you can build with Docker, if needed:

```shell
mvn compile jib:exportDockerContext
```

The Docker context will be created at `target/jib-docker-context` by default. You can change this directory with the `targetDir` configuration option or the `jibTargetDir` parameter:

```shell
mvn compile jib:exportDockerContext -DjibTargetDir=my/docker/context/
```

You can then build your image with Docker:

```shell
docker build -t myimage my/docker/context/
```

## Extended Usage

Extended configuration options provide additional options for customizing the image build.

Field | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`to` | [`to`](#to-object) | *Required* | Configures the target image to build your application to.
`from` | [`from`](#from-object) | See [`from`](#from-object) | Configures the base image to build your application on top of.
`container` | [`container`](#container-object) | See [`container`](#container-object) | Configures the container that is run from your image.
`allowInsecureRegistries` | boolean | `false` | If set to true, Jib ignores HTTPS certificate errors and may fall back to HTTP as a last resort. Leaving this parameter set to `false` is strongly recommended, since HTTP communication is unencrypted and visible to others on the network, and insecure HTTPS is no better than plain HTTP. [If accessing a registry with a self-signed certificate, adding the certificate to your Java runtime's trusted keys](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/docs/self_sign_cert.md) may be an alternative to enabling this option.
`skip` | boolean | `false` | If set to true, Jib execution is skipped (useful for multi-module projects). This can also be specified via the `-Djib.skip` command line option.
`useOnlyProjectCache` | boolean | `false` | If set to true, Jib does not share a cache between different Maven projects.

<a name="from-object"></a>`from` is an object with the following properties:

Property | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`image` | string | `gcr.io/distroless/java` | The image reference for the base image.
`auth` | [`auth`](#auth-object) | *None* | Specify credentials directly (alternative to `credHelper`).
`credHelper` | string | *None* | Suffix for the credential helper that can authenticate pulling the base image (following `docker-credential-`).

<a name="to-object"></a>`to` is an object with the following properties:

Property | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`image` | string | *Required* | The image reference for the target image. This can also be specified via the `-Dimage` command line option.
`auth` | [`auth`](#auth-object) | *None* | Specify credentials directly (alternative to `credHelper`).
`credHelper` | string | *None* | Suffix for the credential helper that can authenticate pulling the base image (following `docker-credential-`).
`tags` | list | *None* | Additional tags to push to.

<a name="auth-object"></a>`auth` is an object with the following properties (see [Using Specific Credentials](#using-specific-credentials)):

Property | Type
--- | ---
`username` | `String`
`password` | `String`

<a name="container-object"></a>`container` is an object with the following properties:

Property | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`appRoot` | string | `/app` | The root directory on the container where the app's contents are placed. 
`args` | list | *None* | Default main method arguments to run your application with.
`entrypoint` | list | *None* | The command to start the container with (similar to Docker's [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) instruction). If set, then `jvmFlags` and `mainClass` are ignored.
`environment` | map | *None* | Key-value pairs for setting environment variables on the container (similar to Docker's [ENV](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env) instruction).
`format` | string | `Docker` | Use `OCI` to build an [OCI container image](https://www.opencontainers.org/).
`jvmFlags` | list | *None* | Additional flags to pass into the JVM when running your application.
`labels` | map | *None* | Key-value pairs for applying image metadata (similar to Docker's [LABEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#label) instruction).
`mainClass` | string | *Inferred\** | The main class to launch the application from.
`ports` | list | *None* | Ports that the container exposes at runtime (similar to Docker's [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) instruction).
`useCurrentTimestamp` | boolean | `false` | By default, Jib wipes all timestamps to guarantee reproducibility. If this parameter is set to `true`, Jib will set the image's creation timestamp to the time of the build, which sacrifices reproducibility for easily being able to tell when your image was created.
`user` | string | `0:0` | The user and group to run the container as. {@code user} can be a username or UID along with an optional groupname or GID. The following are all valid: `user`, `uid`, `user:group`, `uid:gid`, `uid:group`, `user:gid`.

You can also configure HTTP connection/read timeouts for registry interactions using the `jib.httpTimeout` system property, configured in milliseconds via commandline (the default is `20000`; you can also set it to `0` for infinite timeout):

```shell
mvn compile jib:build -Djib.httpTimeout=3000
```

*\* Uses `mainClass` from `maven-jar-plugin` or tries to find a valid main class.*

### Example

In this configuration, the image:
* Is built from a base of `openjdk:alpine` (pulled from Docker Hub)
* Is pushed to `localhost:5000/my-image:built-with-jib`, `localhost:5000/my-image:tag2`, and `localhost:5000/my-image:latest`
* Runs by calling `java -Xms512m -Xdebug -Xmy:flag=jib-rules -cp app/libs/*:app/resources:app/classes mypackage.MyApp some args`
* Exposes port 1000 for tcp (default), and ports 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 for udp
* Has two labels (key1:value1 and key2:value2)
* Is built as OCI format

```xml
<configuration>
  <from>
    <image>openjdk:alpine</image>
  </from>
  <to>
    <image>localhost:5000/my-image:built-with-jib</image>
    <credHelper>osxkeychain</credHelper>
    <tags>
      <tag>tag2</tag>
      <tag>latest</tag>
    </tags>
  </to>
  <container>
    <jvmFlags>
      <jvmFlag>-Xms512m</jvmFlag>
      <jvmFlag>-Xdebug</jvmFlag>
      <jvmFlag>-Xmy:flag=jib-rules</jvmFlag>
    </jvmFlags>
    <mainClass>mypackage.MyApp</mainClass>
    <args>
      <arg>some</arg>
      <arg>args</arg>
    </args>
    <ports>
      <port>1000</port>
      <port>2000-2003/udp</port>
    </ports>
    <labels>
      <key1>value1</key1>
      <key2>value2</key2>
    </labels>
    <format>OCI</format>
  </container>
</configuration>
```

### Adding Arbitrary Files to the Image

*\* Note: this is an incubating feature and may change in the future.*

You can add arbitrary, non-classpath files to the image by placing them in a `src/main/jib` directory. This will copy all files within the `jib` folder to the image's root directory, maintaining the same structure (e.g. if you have a text file at `src/main/jib/dir/hello.txt`, then your image will contain `/dir/hello.txt` after being built with Jib).

You can configure a different directory by using the `extraDirectory` parameter in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<configuration>
  ...
  <!-- Copies files from 'src/main/custom-extra-dir' instead of 'src/main/jib' -->
  <extraDirectory>${project.basedir}/src/main/custom-extra-dir</extraDirectory>
  ...
</configuration>
```

### Authentication Methods

Pushing/pulling from private registries require authorization credentials. These can be [retrieved using Docker credential helpers](#using-docker-credential-helpers) or [defined in your Maven settings](#using-maven-settings). If you do not define credentials explicitly, Jib will try to [use credentials defined in your Docker config](/../../issues/101) or infer common credential helpers.

#### Using Docker Credential Helpers

Docker credential helpers are CLI tools that handle authentication with various registries.

Some common credential helpers include:

* Google Container Registry: [`docker-credential-gcr`](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#docker_credential_helper)
* AWS Elastic Container Registry: [`docker-credential-ecr-login`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper)
* Docker Hub Registry: [`docker-credential-*`](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers)
<!--* Azure Container Registry: [`docker-credential-acr-*`](https://github.com/Azure/acr-docker-credential-helper)
-->

Configure credential helpers to use by specifying them as a `credHelper` for their respective image.

*Example configuration:*
```xml
<configuration>
  ...
  <from>
    <image>aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-base-image</image>
    <credHelper>ecr-login</credHelper>
  </from>
  <to>
    <image>gcr.io/my-gcp-project/my-app</image>
    <credHelper>gcr</credHelper>
  </to>
  ...
</configuration>
```

#### Using Specific Credentials

You can specify credentials directly in the `<auth>` parameter for the `from` and/or `to` images. In the example below, `to` credentials are retrieved from the `REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` environment variables.

```xml
<configuration>
  ...
  <from>
    <image>aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-base-image</image>
    <auth>
      <username>my_username</username>
      <password>my_password</password>
    </auth>
  </from>
  <to>
    <image>gcr.io/my-gcp-project/my-app</image>
    <auth>
      <username>${env.REGISTRY_USERNAME}</username>
      <password>${env.REGISTRY_PASSWORD}</password>
    </auth>
  </to>
  ...
</configuration>
```

Alternatively, you can specify credentials via commandline using the following system properties.

Property | Description
--- | ---
`-Djib.from.auth.username` | Username for base image registry.
`-Djib.from.auth.password` | Password for base image registry.
`-Djib.to.auth.username` | Username for target image registry.
`-Djib.to.auth.password` | Password for target image registry.

e.g. `mvn compile jib:build -Djib.to.auth.username=user -Djib.to.auth.password=pass`

**Note:** This method of authentication should be used only as a last resort, as it is insecure to make your password visible in plain text.

#### Using Maven Settings

Registry credentials can be added to your [Maven settings](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html). These credentials will be used if credentials could not be found in any specified Docker credential helpers.

If you're considering putting credentials in Maven, we highly *recommend* using [maven password encryption](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).

*Example `settings.xml`:*
```xml
<settings>
  ...
  <servers>
    ...
    <server>
      <id>MY_REGISTRY</id>
      <username>MY_USERNAME</username>
      <password>{MY_SECRET}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

* The `id` field should be the registry server these credentials are for.
* We *do not* recommend putting your raw password in `settings.xml`.

### But, I'm not a Java developer.

See [rules_docker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker) for a similar existing container image build tool for the [Bazel build system](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel). The tool can build images for languages such as Python, NodeJS, Java, Scala, Groovy, C, Go, Rust, and D.

### How do I run the image I built?

If you built your image directly to the Docker daemon using `jib:dockerBuild` (Maven) or `jibDockerBuild` (Gradle), you simply need to use `docker run <image name>`.

If you built your image to a registry using `jib:build` (Maven) or `jib` (Gradle), you will need to pull the image using `docker pull <image name>` before using `docker run`.

To run your image on Kubernetes, you can use kubectl:

```shell
kubectl run jib-deployment --image=<image name>
```

For more information, see [steps 4-6 of the Kubernetes Engine deployment tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_4_create_a_container_cluster).

### How do I set parameters for my image at runtime?

#### JVM Flags

For the default `distroless/java` base image, you can use the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable (note that other JRE images may require using other environment variables):

Using Docker: `docker run -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=<JVM flags>" <image name>`

Using Kubernetes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <name>
    image: <image name>
    env:
    - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
      value: <JVM flags>
```

#### Other Environment Variables

Using Docker: `docker run -e "NAME=VALUE" <image name>`

Using Kubernetes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <name>
    image: <image name>
    env:
    - name: NAME
      value: VALUE
```

#### Arguments to Main

Using Docker: `docker run <image name> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3>`

Using Kubernetes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <name>
    image: <image name>
    args:
    - <arg1>
    - <arg2>
    - <arg3>
```

For more information, see the [`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/envvars002.html), the [`docker run -e` reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables), and [defining environment variables for a container in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/).

### What image format does Jib use?

Jib currently builds into the [Docker V2.2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/) image format or [OCI image format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec).

#### Maven

See [Extended Usage](../jib-maven-plugin#extended-usage) for the `<container><format>` configuration.

#### Gradle

See [Extended Usage](../jib-gradle-plugin#extended-usage) for the `container.format` configuration.

### Can I define a custom entrypoint?

The plugin attaches a default entrypoint that will run your application automatically.

When running the image, you can override this default entrypoint with your own custom command.

See [`docker run --entrypoint` reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#entrypoint-default-command-to-execute-at-runtime) for running the image with Docker and overriding the entrypoint command.

See [Define a Command and Arguments for a Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/) for running the image in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Pod and overriding the entrypoint command.

### Where is the application in the container filesystem?

Jib packages your Java application into the following paths on the image:

* `/app/libs/` contains all the dependency artifacts
* `/app/resources/` contains all the resource files
* `/app/classes/` contains all the classes files

### I need to RUN commands like `apt-get`.

Running commands like `apt-get` slows down the container build process. We **do not recommend or support** running commands as part of the build.

However, if you need to run commands, you can build a custom image and configure Jib to use it as the base image.

<details>
<summary>Base image configuration examples</summary>
<p>

#### Maven

In [`jib-maven-plugin`](../jib-maven-plugin), you can then use this custom base image by adding the following configuration:

```xml
<configuration>
  <from>
    <image>custom-base-image</image>
  </from>
</configuration>
```

#### Gradle

In [`jib-gradle-plugin`](../jib-gradle-plugin), you can then use this custom base image by adding the following configuration:

```groovy
jib.from.image = 'custom-base-image'
```
</p>
</details>

### Can I ADD a custom directory to the image?

We currently support adding a custom directory with an **incubating** feature. This feature may change in later versions. If your application needs to use custom files, place them into the `src/main/jib` folder. Files placed here will be added to the filesystem of the container. For example, `src/main/jib/foo/bar` would add `/foo/bar` into the container filesystem.

### Can I build to a local Docker daemon?

There are several ways of doing this:

- Use [`jib:dockerBuild` for Maven](../jib-maven-plugin#build-to-docker-daemon) or [`jibDockerBuild` for Gradle](../jib-gradle-plugin#build-to-docker-daemon) to build directly to your local Docker daemon.
- Use [`jib:buildTar` for Maven](../jib-maven-plugin#build-an-image-tarball) or [`jibBuildTar` for Gradle](../jib-gradle-plugin#build-an-image-tarball) to build the image to a tarball, then use `docker load --input` to load the image into Docker (the tarball built with these commands will be located in `target/jib-image.tar` for Maven and `build/jib-image.tar` for Gradle by default).
- [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) the image built with Jib to have it available in your local Docker daemon.
- Alternatively, instead of using a Docker daemon, you can run a local container registry, such as [Docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) or other repository managers, and point Jib to push to the local registry.

### I am seeing `ImagePullBackoff` on my pods (in [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)).

When you use your private image built with Jib in a [Kubernetes cluster](kubernetes.io), the cluster needs to be configured with credentials to pull the image. This involves 1) creating a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), and 2) using the Secret as [`imagePullSecrets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#add-imagepullsecrets-to-a-service-account).

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-json-key \
  --docker-server=<registry> \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<any valid email address>

kubectl patch serviceaccount default \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets":[{"name":"registry-json-key"}]}'
```

For example, if you are using GCR, the commands would look like (see [Advanced Authentication Methods](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication)):

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry gcr-json-key \
  --docker-server=https://gcr.io \
  --docker-username=_json_key \
  --docker-password="$(cat keyfile.json)" \
  --docker-email=any@valid.com

kubectl patch serviceaccount default \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets":[{"name":"gcr-json-key"}]}'
```

See more at [Using Google Container Registry (GCR) with Minikube](https://ryaneschinger.com/blog/using-google-container-registry-gcr-with-minikube/).

### How do I configure a proxy?

Jib currently requires configuring your build tool to use the appropriate [Java networking properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html) (`https.proxyHost`, `https.proxyPort`, `https.proxyUser`, `https.proxyPassword`).

### How can I diagnose problems pulling or pushing from remote registries?

There are a few reasons why Jib may be unable to connect to a remote registry, including:

- **Access requires a proxy.** See [_How do I configure a proxy?_](#how-do-i-configure-a-proxy) for details.
- **The registry does not support HTTPS.** We do not pass authentication details on non-HTTPS connections, though this can be overridden with the `sendCredentialsOverHttp` system property, but it is not recommend  (_version 0.9.8_).
- **The registry's SSL certificates have expired or are not trusted.**  We have a separate document on [handling registries that use self-signed certificates](self_sign_cert.md), which may also apply if the SSL certificate is signed by an untrusted Certificate Authority.  Jib supports an  `allowInsecureRegistries` flag to ignore SSL certificate validation, but it is not recommend (_version 0.9.8_). 
- **The registry does not support the [Docker Image Format V2 Schema 2](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/601)** (sometimes referred to as _v2-2_).  This problem is usually shown by failures wth `INVALID_MANIFEST` errors. Some registries can be configured to support V2-2 such as [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Docker+Registry#DockerRegistry-LocalDockerRepositories) and [OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.html#middleware-repository-acceptschema2). Other registries, such as Quay.io/Quay Enterprise, are in the process of adding support.

### How can I examine network traffic?

It can be useful to examine network traffic to diagnose connectivity issues. Jib uses the Google HTTP client library to interact with registries which logs HTTP requests using the JVM-provided `java.util.logging` facilities.  It is very helpful to serialize Jib's actions using the `jibSerialize` property.

To see the HTTP traffic, create a `logging.properties` file with the following:
```
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL

# CONFIG hides authentication data
# ALL includes authentication data
com.google.api.client.http.level=CONFIG
```

And then launch your build tool as follows:
```sh
mvn -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/log.properties -DjibSerialize=true ...
```
or
```sh
gradle -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/log.properties -DjibSerialize=true ...
```

### How do I view debug logs for Jib?

Maven: use `mvn -X -DjibSerialize=true` to enable more detailed logging and serialize Jib's actions.

Gradle: use `grade --debug -DjibSerialize=true` to enable more detailed logging and serialize Jib's actions.

### How do I enable debugging?

If using the `distroless/java` base image, then use the [`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`](#how-do-i-set-parameters-for-my-image-at-runtime) to pass along debugging configuration arguments.  For example, to have the remote VM accept debug connections on port 5005, but not suspend:
```
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005
```

Then connect your debugger to port 5005 on the given host.  You can port-forward the container port to a localhost port for easy access.

Using Docker: `docker run -p 5005:5005 <image>`

Using Kubernetes: `kubectl port-forward <pod name> 5005:5005`

### Why is my image created 48 years ago?

For reproducibility purposes, Jib sets the creation time of the container images to 0 (January 1st, 1970). If you would like to forgo reproducibility and use the real creation time, set the `useCurrentTimestamp` parameter to `true` in your build configuration.

#### Maven

```xml
<configuration>
  <container>
    <useCurrentTimestamp>true</useCurrentTimestamp>
  </container>
</configuration>
```

#### Gradle

```groovy
jib.container.useCurrentTimestamp = true
```

### I would like to run my application with a javaagent.

See [Can I ADD a custom directory to the image?](#can-i-add-a-custom-directory-to-the-image).

*TODO: Provide more comprehensive solution.*

### How can I tag my image with a timestamp?

#### Maven

To tag the image with a simple timestamp, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
  <maven.build.timestamp.format>yyyyMMdd-HHmmssSSS</maven.build.timestamp.format>
</properties>
```

Then in the `jib-maven-plugin` configuration, set the `tag` to:

```xml
<configuration>
  <to>
    <image>my-image-name:${maven.build.timestamp}</image>
  </to>
</configuration>
```

You can then use the same timestamp to reference the image in other plugins.

#### Gradle

To tag the image with a timestamp, simply set the timestamp as the tag for `to.image` in your `jib` configuration. For example:

```groovy
jib.to.image = 'gcr.io/my-gcp-project/my-app:' + System.nanoTime()
```

### But, I'm not a Java developer.

See [rules_docker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker) for a similar existing container image build tool for the [Bazel build system](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel). The tool can build images for languages such as Python, NodeJS, Java, Scala, Groovy, C, Go, Rust, and D.

### How do I run the image I built?

If you built your image directly to the Docker daemon using `jib:dockerBuild` (Maven) or `jibDockerBuild` (Gradle), you simply need to use `docker run <image name>`.

If you built your image to a registry using `jib:build` (Maven) or `jib` (Gradle), you will need to pull the image using `docker pull <image name>` before using `docker run`.

To run your image on Kubernetes, you can use kubectl:

```shell
kubectl run jib-deployment --image=<image name>
```

For more information, see [steps 4-6 of the Kubernetes Engine deployment tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app#step_4_create_a_container_cluster).

#### Where is bash?

By default, Jib uses [`distroless/java`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/tree/master/java) as the base image. Distroless images contain only runtime dependencies. They do not contain package managers, shells or any other programs you would expect to find in a standard Linux distribution. Check out the [distroless project](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless#distroless-docker-images) for more information about distroless images.

If you would like to include a shell for debugging, set the base image to `gcr.io/distroless/java:debug` instead. The shell will be located at `/busybox/sh`. Note that `:debug` images are **not** recommended for production use.

<details>
<summary>Configuring a base image in Maven</summary>
<p>

In [`jib-maven-plugin`](../jib-maven-plugin), you can use the `gcr.io/distroless/java:debug` base image by adding the following configuration:

```xml
<configuration>
  <from>
    <image>gcr.io/distroless/java:debug</image>
  </from>
</configuration>
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Configuring a base image in Gradle</summary>
<p>

In [`jib-gradle-plugin`](../jib-gradle-plugin), you can use the `gcr.io/distroless/java:debug` base image by adding the following configuration:

```groovy
jib.from.image = 'gcr.io/distroless/java:debug'
```
</p>
</details><br />

You can then run the image in shell form with Docker: `docker run -it --entrypoint /busybox/sh <image name>`

### How do I set parameters for my image at runtime?

#### JVM Flags

For the default `distroless/java` base image, you can use the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable (note that other JRE images may require using other environment variables):

Using Docker: `docker run -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=<JVM flags>" <image name>`

Using Kubernetes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <name>
    image: <image name>
    env:
    - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
      value: <JVM flags>
```

#### Other Environment Variables

Using Docker: `docker run -e "NAME=VALUE" <image name>`

Using Kubernetes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <name>
    image: <image name>
    env:
    - name: NAME
      value: VALUE
```

#### Arguments to Main

Using Docker: `docker run <image name> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3>`

Using Kubernetes:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: <name>
    image: <image name>
    args:
    - <arg1>
    - <arg2>
    - <arg3>
```

For more information, see the [`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/envvars002.html), the [`docker run -e` reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables), and [defining environment variables for a container in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/).

### What image format does Jib use?

Jib currently builds into the [Docker V2.2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/) image format or [OCI image format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec).

#### Maven

See [Extended Usage](../jib-maven-plugin#extended-usage) for the `<container><format>` configuration.

#### Gradle

See [Extended Usage](../jib-gradle-plugin#extended-usage) for the `container.format` configuration.

### Can I define a custom entrypoint at runtime?

Normally, the plugin sets a default entrypoint for java applications, or lets you configure a custom entrypoint using the `container.entrypoint` configuration parameter. You can also override the default/configured entrypoint by defining a custom entrypoint when running the container. See [`docker run --entrypoint` reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#entrypoint-default-command-to-execute-at-runtime) for running the image with Docker and overriding the entrypoint command, or see [Define a Command and Arguments for a Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/) for running the image in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Pod and overriding the entrypoint command.

### I want to containerize an executable JAR.

Although it is possible to configure Jib to add a JAR to the container and run it using a custom `java -jar ...` or `java -cp ...` entrypoint command, the intention of Jib is to add individual class files and dependency JARs into the container instead of putting a runnable JAR into the container. This lets Jib choose an opinionated, optimal layout for the application on the container image, which also allows it to skip the extra JAR-packaging step.

### Where is the application in the container filesystem?

Jib packages your Java application into the following paths on the image:

* `/app/libs/` contains all the dependency artifacts
* `/app/resources/` contains all the resource files
* `/app/classes/` contains all the classes files
* the contents of the extra directory (default `src/main/jib`) are placed relative to the container's root directory (`/`)

### I need to RUN commands like `apt-get`.

Running commands like `apt-get` slows down the container build process. We **do not recommend or support** running commands as part of the build.

However, if you need to run commands, you can build a custom image and configure Jib to use it as the base image.

<details>
<summary>Base image configuration examples</summary>
<p>

#### Maven

In [`jib-maven-plugin`](../jib-maven-plugin), you can then use this custom base image by adding the following configuration:

```xml
<configuration>
  <from>
    <image>custom-base-image</image>
  </from>
</configuration>
```

#### Gradle

In [`jib-gradle-plugin`](../jib-gradle-plugin), you can then use this custom base image by adding the following configuration:

```groovy
jib.from.image = 'custom-base-image'
```
</p>
</details>

### Can I ADD a custom directory to the image?

We currently support adding a custom directory with an **incubating** feature. This feature may change in later versions. If your application needs to use custom files, place them into the `src/main/jib` folder. Files placed here will be added to the filesystem of the container. For example, `src/main/jib/foo/bar` would add `/foo/bar` into the container filesystem.

### I need to add files generated during the build process to a custom directory on the image.

If the current extra directory design doesn't meet your needs (e.g. you need to set up the extra files directory with files generated during the build process), you can use additional goals/tasks to create the extra directory as part of your build.

<details>
<summary>File copying examples</summary>
<p>

#### Maven

In Maven, you can use the `maven-resources-plugin` to copy files to your extra directory. For example, if you generate files in `target/generated/files` and want to add them to `/my/files` on the container, you can add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugins>
  ...
  <plugin>
    <artifact>jib-maven-plugin</artifact>
    ...
    <configuration>
      <extraDirectory>${project.basedir}/target/extra-directory/</extraDirectory>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ...
  <plugin>
    <artifact>maven-resources-plugin</artifact>
    <version>3.1.0</version>
    <configuration>
      <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}/target/extra-directory/my/files</outputDirectory>
      <resources>
        <resource>
          <directory>${project.basedir}/target/generated/files</directory>
        </resource>
      </resources>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ...
</plugins>
```

The `copy-resources` goal will run automatically before compile, so if you are copying files from your build output to the extra directory, you will need to either set the life-cycle phase to `post-compile` or later, or run the goal manually:

```sh
mvn compile resources:copy-resources jib:build
```

#### Gradle

The same can be accomplished in Gradle by using a `Copy` task. In your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
jib.extraDirectory = file('build/extra-directory')

task setupExtraDir(type: Copy) {
  from file('build/generated/files')
  into file('build/extra-directory/my/files')
}
tasks.jib.dependsOn setupExtraDir
```

The files will be copied to your extra directory when you run the `jib` task.

</p>
</details>

### Can I build to a local Docker daemon?

There are several ways of doing this:

- Use [`jib:dockerBuild` for Maven](../jib-maven-plugin#build-to-docker-daemon) or [`jibDockerBuild` for Gradle](../jib-gradle-plugin#build-to-docker-daemon) to build directly to your local Docker daemon.
- Use [`jib:buildTar` for Maven](../jib-maven-plugin#build-an-image-tarball) or [`jibBuildTar` for Gradle](../jib-gradle-plugin#build-an-image-tarball) to build the image to a tarball, then use `docker load --input` to load the image into Docker (the tarball built with these commands will be located in `target/jib-image.tar` for Maven and `build/jib-image.tar` for Gradle by default).
- [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) the image built with Jib to have it available in your local Docker daemon.
- Alternatively, instead of using a Docker daemon, you can run a local container registry, such as [Docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) or other repository managers, and point Jib to push to the local registry.

### What would a Dockerfile for a Jib-built image look like?

A Dockerfile that performs a Jib-like build is shown below:

```Dockerfile
# Jib uses distroless java as the default base image
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java:latest

# Multiple copy statements are used to break the app into layers, allowing for faster rebuilds after small changes
COPY dependencyJars /app/libs
COPY snapshotDependencyJars /app/libs
COPY resources /app/resources
COPY classFiles /app/classes

# Jib's extra directory ("src/main/jib" by default) is used to add extra, non-classpath files
COPY src/main/jib /

# Jib's default entrypoint when container.entrypoint is not set
ENTRYPOINT ["java", jib.container.jvmFlags, "-cp", "/app/resources:/app/classes:/app/libs/*", jib.container.mainClass]
CMD [jib.container.args]
```

When unset, Jib will infer the value for `jib.container.mainClass`.

Some plugins, such as the [Docker Prepare Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/gclayburg/dockerPreparePlugin), will even automatically generate a Docker context for your project, including a Dockerfile.

### How can I inspect the image Jib built?

To inspect the image that is produced from the build using Docker, you can use commands such as `docker inspect your/image:tag` to view the image configuration, or you can also download the image using `docker save` to manually inspect the container image. Other tools, such as [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive), provide nicer UI to inspect the image.

### I am seeing `ImagePullBackoff` on my pods (in [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)).

When you use your private image built with Jib in a [Kubernetes cluster](kubernetes.io), the cluster needs to be configured with credentials to pull the image. This involves 1) creating a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/), and 2) using the Secret as [`imagePullSecrets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#add-imagepullsecrets-to-a-service-account).

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-json-key \
  --docker-server=<registry> \
  --docker-username=<username> \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<any valid email address>

kubectl patch serviceaccount default \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets":[{"name":"registry-json-key"}]}'
```

For example, if you are using GCR, the commands would look like (see [Advanced Authentication Methods](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication)):

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry gcr-json-key \
  --docker-server=https://gcr.io \
  --docker-username=_json_key \
  --docker-password="$(cat keyfile.json)" \
  --docker-email=any@valid.com

kubectl patch serviceaccount default \
  -p '{"imagePullSecrets":[{"name":"gcr-json-key"}]}'
```

See more at [Using Google Container Registry (GCR) with Minikube](https://ryaneschinger.com/blog/using-google-container-registry-gcr-with-minikube/).

### How do I configure a proxy?

Jib currently requires configuring your build tool to use the appropriate [Java networking properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html) (`https.proxyHost`, `https.proxyPort`, `https.proxyUser`, `https.proxyPassword`).

### How can I diagnose problems pulling or pushing from remote registries?

There are a few reasons why Jib may be unable to connect to a remote registry, including:

- **Access requires a proxy.** See [_How do I configure a proxy?_](#how-do-i-configure-a-proxy) for details.
- **The registry does not support HTTPS.** We do not pass authentication details on non-HTTPS connections, though this can be overridden with the `sendCredentialsOverHttp` system property, but it is not recommend  (_version 0.9.9_).
- **The registry's SSL certificates have expired or are not trusted.**  We have a separate document on [handling registries that use self-signed certificates](self_sign_cert.md), which may also apply if the SSL certificate is signed by an untrusted Certificate Authority.  Jib supports an  `allowInsecureRegistries` flag to ignore SSL certificate validation, but it is not recommend (_version 0.9.9_).
- **The registry does not support the [Docker Image Format V2 Schema 2](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/601)** (sometimes referred to as _v2-2_).  This problem is usually shown by failures wth `INVALID_MANIFEST` errors. Some registries can be configured to support V2-2 such as [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Docker+Registry#DockerRegistry-LocalDockerRepositories) and [OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.html#middleware-repository-acceptschema2). Other registries, such as Quay.io/Quay Enterprise, are in the process of adding support.

### How can I examine network traffic?

It can be useful to examine network traffic to diagnose connectivity issues. Jib uses the Google HTTP client library to interact with registries which logs HTTP requests using the JVM-provided `java.util.logging` facilities.  It is very helpful to serialize Jib's actions using the `jibSerialize` property.

To see the HTTP traffic, create a `logging.properties` file with the following:
```
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL

# CONFIG hides authentication data
# ALL includes authentication data
com.google.api.client.http.level=CONFIG
```

And then launch your build tool as follows:
```sh
mvn -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/log.properties -DjibSerialize=true ...
```
or
```sh
gradle -Djava.util.logging.config.file=path/to/log.properties -DjibSerialize=true ...
```

### How do I view debug logs for Jib?

Maven: use `mvn -X -DjibSerialize=true` to enable more detailed logging and serialize Jib's actions.

Gradle: use `grade --debug -DjibSerialize=true` to enable more detailed logging and serialize Jib's actions.

### How do I enable debugging?

If using the `distroless/java` base image, then use the [`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`](#how-do-i-set-parameters-for-my-image-at-runtime) to pass along debugging configuration arguments.  For example, to have the remote VM accept local debug connections on port 5005, but not suspend:
```
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=localhost:5005
```

Then connect your debugger to port 5005 on your local host.  You can port-forward the container port to a localhost port for easy access.

Using Docker: `docker run -p 5005:5005 <image>`

Using Kubernetes: `kubectl port-forward <pod name> 5005:5005`

Beware: in Java 8 and earlier, specifying only a port meant that the JDWP socket was open to all incoming connections which is insecure.  It is recommended to limit the debug port to localhost.

### Why is my image created 48+ years ago?

For reproducibility purposes, Jib sets the creation time of the container images to 0 (January 1st, 1970). If you would like to forgo reproducibility and use the real creation time, set the `useCurrentTimestamp` parameter to `true` in your build configuration.

#### Maven

```xml
<configuration>
  <container>
    <useCurrentTimestamp>true</useCurrentTimestamp>
  </container>
</configuration>
```

#### Gradle

```groovy
jib.container.useCurrentTimestamp = true
```

#### Please tell me more about reproducibility!

_Reproducible_ means that given the same inputs, a build should produce the same outputs.  Container images are uniquely identified by a digest (or a hash) of the image contents and image metadata.  Tools and infrastructure such the Docker daemon, Docker Hub, registries, Kubernetes, etc) treat images with different digests as being different.

To ensure that a Jib build is reproducible — that the rebuilt container image has the same digest — Jib adds files and directories in a consistent order, and sets consistent creation- and modification-times and permissions for all files and directories.  Jib also ensures that the image metadata is recorded in a consistent order, and that the container image has a consistent creation time.  To ensure consistent times, files and directories are recorded as having a creation and modification time of 1 second past the Unix Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:01.000 UTC), and the container image is recorded as being created on the Unix Epoch.  Setting `container.useCurrentTimestamp=true` and then rebuilding an image will produce a different timestamp for the image creation time, and so the container images will have different digests and appear to be different.

For more details see [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org).


### I would like to run my application with a javaagent.

You can run your container with a javaagent by placing it somewhere in the `src/main/jib` directory to add it to the container's filesystem, then pointing to it using Jib's `container.jvmFlags` configuration.

#### Maven

```xml
<configuration>
  <container>
    <jvmFlags>
      <jvmFlag>-javaagent:/myfolder/agent.jar</jvmFlag>
    </jvmFlags>    
  </container>
</configuration>
```

#### Gradle

```groovy
jib.container.jvmFlags = ['-javaagent:/myfolder/agent.jar']
```

See also [Can I ADD a custom directory to the image?](#can-i-add-a-custom-directory-to-the-image)

### How can I tag my image with a timestamp?

#### Maven

To tag the image with a simple timestamp, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
  <maven.build.timestamp.format>yyyyMMdd-HHmmssSSS</maven.build.timestamp.format>
</properties>
```

Then in the `jib-maven-plugin` configuration, set the `tag` to:

```xml
<configuration>
  <to>
    <image>my-image-name:${maven.build.timestamp}</image>
  </to>
</configuration>
```

You can then use the same timestamp to reference the image in other plugins.

#### Gradle

To tag the image with a timestamp, simply set the timestamp as the tag for `to.image` in your `jib` configuration. For example:

```groovy
jib.to.image = 'gcr.io/my-gcp-project/my-app:' + System.nanoTime()
```

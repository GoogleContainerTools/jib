/**
 * Represents a Decentralized Allocation Tree (DAT) node.
 *
 * <p>A DAT node is immutable and pointers only go in the direction from child to parent. Each node
 * has a set number of allocated units, the total of which represents a single allocation unit of
 * its parent. Each node is therefore a sub-allocation of its parent node. This allows the DAT to
 * sub-allocate progress in a decentralized, asynchronous manner.
 *
 * <p>For example, thread 1 creates node A as the root node with 2 allocation units. A subtask is
 * launched on thread 1 and creates node B with 3 allocation units as a child of node A. Thread 1
 * then also launches a subtask on thread 2 that creates node C with 5 allocation units. Once the
 * first subtask finishes and reports its progress, that completion would entail completion of 3
 * allocation units of node B and 1 allocation unit of node A. The second subtask finishes and
 * reports its progress as well, indicating completion of 5 units of node C and thus 1 unit of node
 * A. Allocation A is then deemed complete as well in terms of overall progress.
 *
 * <p>Note that it is up to the user of the class to ensure that the number of sub-allocations does
 * not exceed the number of allocation units.

## [unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 0.12.0

### Added

- Main class inference support for Java 13/14. ([#2015](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2015))
- `Containerizer#setAlwaysCacheBaseImage(boolean)` controls the optimization to skip downloading base image layers that exist in a target registry. ([#1870](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1870))

### Changed

- Local base image layers are now processed in parallel, speeding up builds using large local base images. ([#1913](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1913))
- The base image manifest is no longer pulled from the registry if a digest is provided and the manifest is already cached. ([#1881](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1881))
- Docker daemon base images are now cached more effectively, speeding up builds using `DockerDaemonImage` base images. ([#1912](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1912))
- Now ignores `jib.alwaysCacheBaseImage` system property. Use `Containerizer#setAlwaysCacheBaseImage(boolean)` instead. ([#1870](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1870))

### Fixed

- Fixed temporary directory cleanup during builds using local base images. ([#2016](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2016))
- Fixed additional tags being ignored when building to a tarball. ([#2043](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2043))
- Fixed `TarImage` base image failing if tar does not contain explicit directory entries. ([#2067](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2067))

## 0.11.0

### Added

- `Jib#from` and `JavaContainerBuilder#from` overloads to allow using a `DockerDaemonImage` or a `TarImage` as the base image. ([#1468](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1468), [#1905](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1905))
- `Jib#from(String)` accepts strings prefixed with `docker://`, `tar://`, or `registry://` to specify image type.

### Changed

- To disable parallel execution, the property `jib.serialize` should be used instead of `jibSerialize`. ([#1968](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1968))
- `TarImage` is constructed using `TarImage.at(...).named(...)` instead of `TarImage.named(...).saveTo(...)`. ([#1918](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1918))
- For retrieving credentials from Docker config (`~/.docker/config.json`), `credHelpers` now takes precedence over `credsStore`, followed by `auths`. ([#1958](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1958))
- The legacy `credsStore` no longer requires defining empty registry entries in `auths` to be used. This now means that if `credsStore` is defined, `auths` will be completely ignored. ([#1958](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1958))

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue interacting with certain registries due to changes to URL handling in the underlying Apache HttpClient library. ([#1924](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1924))
- Fixed the regression of slow network operations introduced at 0.10.1. ([#1980](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1980))
- Fixed an issue where connection timeout sometimes fell back to attempting plain HTTP (non-HTTPS) requests when the `Containerizer` is set to allow insecure registries. ([#1949](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1949))

## 0.10.1

### Added

- `JavaContainerBuilder#setLastModifiedTimeProvider` to set file timestamps. ([#1818](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1818))

### Changed

- `JibContainerBuilder#addDependencies` is now split into three methods: `addDependencies`, `addSnapshotDependencies`, `addProjectDependencies`. ([#1773](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1773))
- For building and pushing to a registry, Jib now skips downloading and caching base image layers if the layers already exist in the target registry. This feature will be particularly useful in CI/CD environments. However, if you want to force caching base image layers locally, set the system property `-Djib.alwaysCacheBaseImage=true`. ([#1840](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1840))

### Fixed

- Manifest lists referenced directly by sha256 are automatically parsed and the first `linux/amd64` manifest is used. ([#1811](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1811))

## 0.10.0

### Added

- `Containerizer#addEventHandler` for adding event handlers.

### Changed

- Multiple classes have been moved to the `com.google.cloud.tools.jib.api` package.
- Event handlers are now added directly to the `Containerizer` rather than adding them to an `EventHandlers` object first.
- Removed multiple classes to simplify the event system (`JibEventType`, `BuildStepType`, `EventDispatcher`, `DefaultEventDispatcher`, `LayerCountEvent`)
- MainClassFinder now uses a static method instead of requiring instantiation.

## 0.9.2

### Added

- Container configurations in the base image are now propagated when registry uses the old V2 image manifest, schema version 1 (such as Quay). ([#1641](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1641))
- `Containerizer#setOfflineMode` to retrieve the base image from Jib's cache rather than a container registry. ([#718](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/718))

### Fixed

- Labels in the base image are now propagated. ([#1643](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1643))
- Fixed an issue with using OCI base images. ([#1683](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1683))

## 0.9.1

### Added

- Overloads for `LayerConfiguration#addEntryRecursive` that take providers to set file permissions and file modification time on a per-file basis. ([#1607](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1607))

### Changed

- `LayerConfiguration` takes file modification time as an `Instant` instead of a `long`.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where automatically generated parent directories in a layer did not get their timestamp configured correctly to epoch + 1s. ([#1648](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1648))
- Fixed an issue where the library creates wrong images by adding base image layers in reverse order when registry uses the old V2 image manifest, schema version 1 (such as Quay). ([#1627](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1627))

## 0.9.0

### Added

- `JavaContainerBuilder#setAppRoot()` and `JavaContainerBuilder#fromDistrolessJetty()` for building WAR containers. ([#1464](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1464))
- `Jib#fromScratch()` to start building from an empty base image. ([#1471](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1471))
- Methods in `JavaContainerBuilder` for setting the destination directories for classes, resources, directories, and additional classpath files.

### Changed

- Allow skipping `JavaContainerBuilder#setMainClass()` to skip setting the entrypoint.
- `os` and `architecture` are taken from base image. ([#1564](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1564))

### Fixed

- `ImageReference` assumes `registry-1.docker.io` as the registry if the host part of an image reference is `docker.io`. ([#1549](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1549))

## 0.1.2

### Added

- `ProgressEvent#getBuildStepType` method to get which step in the build process a progress event corresponds to. ([#1449](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1449))
- `LayerCountEvent` that is dispatched at the beginning of certain pull/build/push build steps to indicate the number of layers being processed. ([#1461](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1461))

### Changed

- `JibContainerBuilder#containerize()` throws multiple sub-types of `RegistryException` rather than wrapping them in an `ExecutionException`. ([#1440](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1440))

### Fixed

- `MainClassFinder` failure when main method is defined using varargs (i.e. `public static void main(String... args)`). ([#1456](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1456))

## 0.1.1

### Added

- Adds support for configuring volumes. ([#1121](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1121))
- Adds `JavaContainerBuilder` for building opinionated containers for Java applications. ([#1212](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1212))

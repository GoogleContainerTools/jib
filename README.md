| ☑️  Jib User Survey |
| :----- |
| What do you like best about Jib? What needs to be improved? Please tell us by taking a [one-minute survey](https://forms.gle/YRFeamGj51xmgnx28). Your responses will help us understand Jib usage and allow us to serve our customers (you!) better. |

## What is Jib?

Jib builds optimized Docker and [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon - and without deep mastery of Docker best-practices. It is available as plugins for [Maven](jib-maven-plugin) and [Gradle](jib-gradle-plugin) and as a Java library.

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): See documentation for [jib-maven-plugin](jib-maven-plugin).\
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/): See documentation for [jib-gradle-plugin](jib-gradle-plugin).\
[Jib Core](jib-core): A general-purpose container-building library for Java.\
[Jib CLI](jib-cli): A command-line interface for building images that uses Jib Core.

For more information, check out the [official blog post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/introducing-jib-build-java-docker-images-better.html) or watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6gR_Cv4yWI) ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/coollog/build-containers-faster-with-jib-a-google-image-build-tool-for-java-applications)).

## Goals

* **Fast** - Deploy your changes fast. Jib separates your application into multiple layers, splitting dependencies from classes. Now you don’t have to wait for Docker to rebuild your entire Java application - just deploy the layers that changed.

* **Reproducible** - Rebuilding your container image with the same contents always generates the same image. Never trigger an unnecessary update again.

* **Daemonless** - Reduce your CLI dependencies. Build your Docker image from within Maven or Gradle and push to any registry of your choice. *No more writing Dockerfiles and calling docker build/push.*

## Quickstart

* **Maven** - See the jib-maven-plugin [Quickstart](jib-maven-plugin#quickstart).

* **Gradle** - See the jib-gradle-plugin [Quickstart](jib-gradle-plugin#quickstart).

* **Jib Core** - See the Jib Core [Quickstart](jib-core#adding-jib-core-to-your-build).

* **Jib CLI** - See the Jib CLI [doc](jib-cli).

## Examples

The [examples](examples) directory includes the following examples (and more).
   * [helloworld](examples/helloworld)
   * [Spring Boot](examples/spring-boot)
   * [Micronaut](examples/micronaut)
   * [Multi-module project](examples/multi-module)
   * [Spark Java using Java Agent](examples/java-agent)

## How Jib Works

Whereas traditionally a Java application is built as a single image layer with the application JAR, Jib's build strategy separates the Java application into multiple layers for more granular incremental builds. When you change your code, only your changes are rebuilt, not your entire application. These layers, by default, are layered on top of the [AdoptOpenJDK](https://hub.docker.com/_/adoptopenjdk) base image, but you can also configure a custom base image. For more information, check out the [official blog post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/07/introducing-jib-build-java-docker-images-better.html) or watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6gR_Cv4yWI) ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/coollog/build-containers-faster-with-jib-a-google-image-build-tool-for-java-applications)).

See also [rules_docker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker) for a similar existing container image build tool for the [Bazel build system](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel).

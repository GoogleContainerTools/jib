# Proposal: Control the pushing of tags on existing images in target registry

Relevant issues: [#2360](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2360)

## Motivation
Currently Jib pushes tags for all built images, irrelevant of whether the image is already 
present on the target registry. 

As highlighted by @loosebazooka [#2360](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2360) 
this can be particularly annoying if some automated orchestrator is monitoring the registry
and releases any new tags found. This issue is especially prevalent in cases where the tags are
auto-generated by CI systems and added with every triggered build.

## Proposal
The idea is to give the user the ability to control this functionality by means of a switch/option. 
There might be use-cases where the current behaviour is preferable, eg, where the tags follow semantic 
versioning, or where the tags are not automatically generated. Hence, adding a switch seems to be 
a better solution rather than changing the current behaviour.

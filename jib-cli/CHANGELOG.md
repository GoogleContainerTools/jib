### Added
- Added the `jar` command which can be used to containerize a JAR. Currently offering two modes: `exploded`, where the contents of the JAR are put into optimized layers on the container, and `packaged`, where the JAR is containerized as is.([#11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/projects/11))

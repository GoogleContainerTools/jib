# Jib CLI

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-preview-orange">

`jib` is a general-purpose command-line utility for building Docker or [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) container images from file system content as well as JAR files. Jib CLI builds containers [fast and reproducibly without Docker](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib#goals) like [other Jib tools](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib#what-is-jib).

```sh
# docker not required
$ docker
-bash: docker: command not found
# build and upload an image
$ jib build --target=my-registry.example.com/built-by-jib
```

Additionally, Jib CLI can directly build an optimized image for JAR files (including Spring Boot fat JAR).
```sh
$ jib jar --target=my-registry.example.com/jar-app myapp.jar
```

The CLI tool is powered by [Jib Core](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-core), a Java library for building containers without Docker.

## Get the Jib CLI

Most users should download a ZIP archive (Java application). We are working on releasing a native executable binary.

### Download a Java Application

A JRE is required to run this Jib CLI distribution.

Find the [latest jib-cli 0.2.0 release](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/releases/tag/v0.2.0-cli) on the [Releases page](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/releases), download `jib-jre-<version>.zip`, and unzip it. The zip file contains the `jib` (`jib.bat` for Windows) script at `jib/bin/`. Optionally, add the binary directory to your `$PATH` so that you can call `jib` from anywhere.

### Build Yourself from Source (for Advanced Users)

Use the `application` plugin's `installDist` task to create a runnable installation in
`build/install/jib`.  A zip and tar file are also created in `build/distributions`.
```sh
# build
$ ./gradlew jib-cli:installDist
# run
$ ./jib-cli/build/install/jib/bin/jib

```
## Supported Commands

The Jib CLI supports two commands:
 1. `build` - containerizes using a [build file](#fully-annotated-jibyaml).
 2. `jar` - containerizes JAR files.

## Build Command
This command follows the following pattern:
```
jib build --target <image name> [options]
```
### Quickstart
1. Create a hello world script (`script.sh`) containing:
    ```
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hello World"
    ```
2. Create a buildfile. The default is a file named `jib.yaml` in the project root.
    ```
    apiVersion: jib/v1alpha1
    kind: BuildFile
    
    from:
      image: ubuntu
    
    entrypoint: ["./script.sh"]
    
    layers:
      entries:
        - name: scripts
          files:
            - properties:
                filePermissions: 755
              src: script.sh
              dest: /script.sh

    ``` 
3. Build to docker daemon
   ```
    $ jib build --target=docker://jib-cli-quickstart
   ```
4. Run the container
   ```
    $ docker run jib-cli-quickstart
    Hello World
   ```

### Fully Annotated `jib.yaml`

  entries:
    - name: "scripts"                # first layer
      properties:                    # file properties applied to only this layer
        filePermissions: "123"           
        # see above for full list of properties...
      files:                         # a list of copy directives constitute a single layer
        - src: "project/run.sh"      # a simple copy directive (inherits layer level file properties)
          dest: "/home/run.sh"       # all 'dest' specifications must be absolute paths on the container
        - src: "scripts"             # a second copy directive in the same layer
          dest: "/home/scripts"
          excludes:                  # exclude all files matching these patterns
            - "**/exclude.me"
            - "**/*.ignore"
          includes:                  # include only files matching these patterns
            - "**/include.me"            
          properties:                # file properties applied to only this copy directive
            filePermissions: "123"           
            # see above for full list of properties...  
    - name: "images"                 # second layer, inherits file properties from global
      files:
        - src: "images"
        - dest: "/images"            
```

#### Layers Behavior
- Copy directives are bound by the following rules
  `src`: filetype determined by type on local disk
   - if `src` is directory, `dest` is always considered a directory, directory and contents will be copied over and renamed to `dest`
   - if `src` is file
     - if `dest` ends with `/` then it is considered a target directory, file will be copied into directory
     - if `dest` doesn't end with `/` then is is the target file location, `src` file will be copied and renamed to `dest`
- Permissions for a file or directory that appear in multiple layers will prioritize the *last* layer and copy directive the file appears in. In the following example, `file.txt` as seen on the running container will have filePermissions `234`.
    ```
    - name: layer1
      properties:
        filePermissions: "123"
      - src: file.txt
        dest: /file.txt
    - name: layer2
      properties:
        filePermissions: "234"
      - src: file.txt
        dest: /file.txt
     ```
- Parent directories that are not exiplicitly defined in a layer will the default properties in jib-core (permissions: 755, modification-time: epoch+1). In the following example, `/somewhere` on the container will have the directory permissions `755`, not `777` as some might expect.
    ```
    - name: layer
      properties:
        directoryPermissions: "777"
      - src: file.txt
        dest: /somewhere/file.txt
    ```
- `excludes` on a directory can lead to unintended inclusion of files in the directory, to exclude a directory *and* all its files
     ```
     excludes:
       - "**/exclude-dir"
       - "**/exclude-dir/**
     ```
     
#### Base Image Parameter Inheritance
Some values defined in the base image may be preserved and propogated into the new container.

Parameters will append to base image value:
- `volumes`
- `exposedPorts`

Parameters that will append any new keys, and overwrite existing keys:
- `labels`
- `environment`

Parameters that will be overwritten:
- `user`
- `workingDirectory`
- `entrypoint`
- `cmd`


### Options
Optional flags for the `build` command:

Option | Description
---     | ---
`-b, --build-file` |  The path to the build file (ex: path/to/other-jib.yaml)
`-c, --context`    |  The context root directory of the build (ex: path/to/my/build/things)
`-p, --parameter`  |  Templating parameter to inject into build file, replace ${<name>} with <value> (repeatable)


## Jar Command
This command follows the following pattern:
```
jib jar --target <image name> path/to/myapp.jar [options]
```

### Options
Optional flags for the `jar` command:

Option | Description
---       | ---
`--creation-time` | The creation time of the container in milliseconds since epoch or iso8601 format. Overrides the default (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)

## Common Jib CLI Options
The options can either be specified in the command line or defined in a configuration file:
```
[@<filename>...]      One or more argument files containing options.
```
### Auth/Security
```
    --allow-insecure-registries            Allow jib to send credentials over http (insecure)
    --send-credentials-over-http           Allow jib to send credentials over http (very insecure)
```

### Credentials
Credentials can be specified using credential helpers or username + password. The following options are available:

```
    --credential-helper <credHelper>      credential helper for communicating with both target and base image registries, either a path to the helper, or a suffix for an executable named `docker-credential-<suffix>`
    --to-crendential-helper <credHelper>  credential helper for communicating with target registry, either a path to the helper, or a suffix for an executable named `docker-credential-<suffix>
    --from-credential-helper <credHelper> credential helper for communicating with base image registry, either a path to the helper, or a suffix for an executable named `docker-credential-<suffix>`

    --username <username>                  username for communicating with both target and base image registries
    --password <password>                  password for communicating with both target and base image registries
    --to-username <username>               username for communicating with target image registry
    --to-password <password>               password for communicating with target image registry
    --from-username <username>             username for communicating with base image registry

Only Credential Helper
1. `--credential-helper`
2. `--to-credential-helper`
3. `--from-credential-helper`
4. `--to-credential-helper`, `--from-credential-helper`

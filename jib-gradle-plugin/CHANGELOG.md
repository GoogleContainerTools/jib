All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 3.1.2

### Fixed

- Fixed the bug introduced in 3.1 that constructs a wrong Java runtime classpath when two dependencies have the same artifact ID and version but different group IDs. The bug occurs only when using Java 9+ or setting `jib.container.expandClasspathDependencies`. ([#3331](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3331))

## 3.1.1

### Fixed

- Fixed the regression introduced in 3.1.0 where a build may fail due to an error from main class inference even if `jib.container.entrypoint` is configured. ([#3295](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3295))

## 3.1.0

### Added

- For Google Artifact Registry (`*-docker.pkg.dev`), Jib now tries [Google Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) last like it has been doing for `gcr.io`. ([#3241](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3241))
- Added lazy evaluation for `jib.container.labels` using Gradle Property and Provider. ([#3242](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3242))

### Changed

- Jib now creates an additional layer that contains two small text files: [`/app/jib-classpath-file` and `/app/jib-main-class-file`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin/README.md#custom-container-entrypoint). They hold, respectively, the final Java runtime classpath and the main class computed by Jib that are suitable for app execution on JVM. For example, with Java 9+, setting the container entrypoint to `java --class-path @/app/jib-classpath-file @/app/jib-main-class-file` will work to start the app. (This is basically the default entrypoint set by Jib when the entrypoint is not explicitly configured by the user.) The files are always generated whether Java 8 or 9+, or whether `jib.container.entrypoint` is explicitly configured. The files can be helpful especially when setting a custom entrypoint for a shell script that needs to get the classpath and the main class computed by Jib, or for [AppCDS](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2471). ([#3280](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3280))
- For Java 9+ apps, the default Java runtime classpath explicitly lists all the app dependencies, preserving the dependency loading order declared by Gradle. This is done by changing the default entrypoint to use the new classpath JVM argument file (basically `java -cp @/app/jib-classpath-file`). As such, `jib.container.expandClasspathDependencies` takes no effect for Java 9+. ([#3280](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3280))
- Timestamps of file entries in a tarball built with `jibBuildTar` are set to the epoch, making the tarball reproducible. ([#3158](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3158))

## 3.0.0

### Added

- New `includes` and `excludes` options for `jib.extraDirectories`. This enables copying a subset of files from the source directory using glob patterns. ([#2564](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2564))
- Added an option `configurationName` to specify the name of the [Gradle Configuration](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ConfigurationContainer.html) to use. The option can be lazily configured, for example, using Gradle `Provider` or `Property`. ([#3034](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3034))
```gradle
    jib {
      configurationName = 'myconfig'
    }
```                                                                                                                                                                      
  
### Changed

- [Switched the default base images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/docs/default_base_image.md) from Distroless to [`adoptopenjdk:{8,11}-jre`](https://hub.docker.com/_/adoptopenjdk) and [`jetty`](https://hub.docker.com/_/jetty) (for WAR). ([#3124](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3124))

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where some log messages used color in the "plain" console output. ([#2764](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2764))

## 2.8.0

### Added

- Added support for [configuring registry mirrors](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/docs/faq.md#i-am-hitting-docker-hub-rate-limits-how-can-i-configure-registry-mirrors) for base images. This is useful when hitting [Docker Hub rate limits](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits). Only public mirrors (such as `mirror.gcr.io`) are supported. ([#3011](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3011))

### Changed

- Build will fail if Jib cannot create or read the [global Jib configuration file](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-gradle-plugin#global-jib-configuration). ([#2996](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2996))

## 2.7.1

### Fixed

- Updated jackson dependency version causing compatibility issues. ([#2931](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2931))
- Deprecated use of `@Optional` on boolean attribute ([#2930](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2930))

## 2.7.0

### Added

- Added an option `jib.container.expandClasspathDependencies` to preserve the order of loading dependencies as configured in a project. The option enumerates dependency JARs instead of using a wildcard (`/app/libs/*`) in the Java runtime classpath for an image entrypoint. ([#1871](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1871), [#1907](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1907), [#2228](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2228), [#2733](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2733))
    - The option is also useful for AppCDS. ([#2471](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2471))
    - Turning on the option may result in a very long classpath string, and the OS may not support passing such a long string to JVM.
- Added lazy evaluation for `jib.(to|from).auth.(username|password)` and `jib.from.image` using Gradle Property and Provider. ([#2905](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2905))

### Fixed

- Fixed `NullPointerException` when pulling an OCI base image whose manifest does not have `mediaType` information. ([#2819](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2819))
- Fixed build failure when using a Docker daemon base image (`docker://...`) that has duplicate layers. ([#2829](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2829))

## 2.6.0

### Added

- Added lazy evaluation for `jib.to.image` and `jib.to.tags` using Gradle Property and Provider. ([#2727](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2727))
- _Incubating feature_: can now configure multiple platforms (such as architectures) to build multiple images as a bundle and push as a manifest list (also known as a fat manifest). As an incubating feature, there are certain limitations. For example, OCI image indices are not supported, and building a manifest list is supported only for registry pushing (the `jib` task). ([#2523](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2523))
   ```gradle
   jib.from {
     image = '... image reference to a manifest list ...'
     platforms {
       platform {
         architecture = 'arm64'
         os = 'linux'
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Changed

- Previous locally cached base image manifests will be ignored, as the caching mechanism changed to enable multi-platform image building. ([#2730](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2730), [#2711](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2711))
- Upgraded the ASM library to 9.0 to resolve an issue when auto-inferring main class in Java 15+. ([#2776](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2776))

### Fixed

- Fixed `NullPointerException` during input validation (in Java 9+) when configuring Jib parameters using certain immutable collections (such as `List.of()`). ([#2702](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2702))
- Fixed authentication failure with Azure Container Registry when using ["tokens"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-repository-scoped-permissions). ([#2784](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2784))
- Improved authentication flow for base image registry. ([#2134](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2134))
- Throw `IllegalArgumentException` with an error message instead of throwing a `NullPointerException` when `jib.to.tags` is set to a collection containing a `null` value. ([#2760](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2760))

## 2.5.1

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that configuring `jib.from.platforms` was always additive to the default `amd64/linux` platform. ([#2783](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2783))

## 2.5.0

### Added

- Also tries `.exe` file extension for credential helpers on Windows. ([#2527](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2527))
- New system property `jib.skipExistingImages` (false by default) to skip pushing images (manifests) if the image already exists in the registry. ([#2360](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2360))
- _Incubating feature_: can now configure desired platform (architecture and OS) to select the matching manifest from a Docker manifest list. Currently supports building only one image. OCI image indices are not supported. ([#1567](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1567))
   ```gradle
   jib.from {
     image = '... image reference to a manifest list ...'
     platforms {
       platform {
         architecture = 'arm64'
         os = 'linux'
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Fixed

- Fixed reporting a wrong credential helper name when the helper does not exist on Windows. ([#2527](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2527))
- Fixed `NullPointerException` when the `"auths":` section in `~/.docker/config.json` has an entry with no `"auth":` field. ([#2535](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2535))
- Fixed `NullPointerException` to return a helpful message when a server does not provide any message in certain error cases (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, and 405 Method Not Allowed). ([#2532](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2532))
- Now supports sending client certificate (for example, via the `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` and `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword` system properties) and thus enabling mutual TLS authentication. ([#2585](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2585), [#2226](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2226))
- Fixed an issue where Jib cannot infer Kotlin main class that takes no arguments. ([#2666](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2666))

## 2.4.0

### Added

- Jib Extension Framework! The framework enables anyone to easily extend and tailor the Jib Gradle plugin behavior to their liking. Check out the new [Jib Extensions](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib-extensions) GitHub repository to learn more. ([#2401](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2401))
- Project dependencies in a multi-module WAR project are now stored in a separate "project dependencies" layer (as currently done for a non-WAR project). ([#2450](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2450))

### Changed

- Previous locally cached application layers (`<project root>/target/jib-cache`) will be ignored because of changes to the caching selectors. ([#2499](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2499))

### Fixed

- Fixed authentication failure with Azure Container Registry when using an identity token defined in the `auths` section of Docker config (`~/.docker/config.json`). ([#2488](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2488))

## 2.3.0

### Added

- `jib.extraDirectories.paths` closure to allow configuring the source and target of an extra directory. ([#1581](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1581))

### Fixed

- Fixed the problem not inheriting `USER` container configuration from a base image. ([#2421](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2421))
- Fixed wrong capitalization of JSON properties in a loadable Docker manifest when building a tar image. ([#2430](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2430))
- Fixed an issue when using a base image whose image creation timestamp contains timezone offset. ([#2428](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2428))
- Fixed an issue inferring a wrong main class or using an invalid main class (for example, Spring Boot project containing multiple main classes). ([#2456](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2456))

## 2.2.0

### Added

- Glob pattern support for `jib.extraDirectories.permissions`. ([#1200](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1200))
- Support for image references with both a tag and a digest. ([#1481](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1481))
- The `DOCKER_CONFIG` environment variable specifying the directory containing docker configs is now checked during credential retrieval. ([#1618](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1618))
- Also tries `.cmd` file extension for credential helpers on Windows. ([#2399](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2399))

### Changed

- `jib.container.creationTime` now accepts more timezone formats:`+HHmm`. This allows for easier configuration of creationTime by external systems. ([#2320](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2320))

## 2.1.0

### Added

- Additionally reads credentials from `~/.docker/.dockerconfigjson` and legacy Docker config (`~/.docker/.dockercfg`). Also searches for `$HOME/.docker/*` (in addition to current `System.get("user.home")/.docker/*`). This may help retrieve credentials, for example, on Kubernetes. ([#2260](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2260))
- New skaffold configuration options that modify how jib's build config is presented to skaffold ([#2292](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2292)):
    - `jib.skaffold.watch.buildIncludes`: a list of build files to watch
    - `jib.skaffold.watch.includes`: a list of project files to watch
    - `jib.skaffold.watch.excludes`: a list of files to exclude from watching
    - `jib.skaffold.sync.excludes`: a list of files to exclude from sync'ing

### Fixed

- Fixed authentication failure with error `server did not return 'WWW-Authenticate: Bearer' header` in certain cases (for example, on OpenShift). ([#2258](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2258))
- Fixed an issue where using local Docker images (by `docker://...`) on Windows caused an error. ([#2270](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2270))
- Fixed build failures with Skaffold when the Gradle Java Platform plugin is applied. ([#2269](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2269))
- For Spring Boot projects using `containerizingMode = 'packaged'`, Jib now overrides `archiveClassifier` of the `jar` task only when safe and necessary. ([#2278](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2278))
- Fixed an issue where user-configured task dependencies for the Jib task is overwritten and thus ineffective. ([#2289](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2289))

## 2.0.0

### Added

- Added json output file for image metadata after a build is complete. Writes to `build/jib-image.json` by default, configurable with `jib.outputPaths.imageJson`. ([#2227](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2227))
- Added automatic update checks. Jib will now display a message if there is a new version of Jib available. See the [privacy page](../docs/privacy.md) for more details. ([#2193](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2193))

### Changed

- Removed `jibDockerBuild.dockerClient` in favor of `jib.dockerClient`. ([#1983](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1983))
- Removed deprecated `jib.extraDirectory` configuration in favor of `jib.extraDirectories`. ([#1691](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1691))
- Removed deprecated `jib.container.useCurrentTimestamp` configuration in favor of `jib.container.creationTime` with `USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. ([#1897](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1897))
- HTTP redirection URLs are no longer sanitized in order to work around an issue with certain registries that do not conform to HTTP standards. This resolves an issue with using Red Hat OpenShift and Quay registries. ([#2106](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2106), [#1986](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1986#issuecomment-547610104))
- Requires Gradle 5.1 or newer (up from 4.9).
- The default base image cache location has been changed on MacOS and Windows. ([#2216](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2216))
    - MacOS (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` defined): from `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/google-cloud-tools-java/jib/` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Google/Jib/`
    - MacOS (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` not defined): from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/google-cloud-tools-java/jib/` to `$HOME/Library/Caches/Google/Jib/`
    - Windows (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` defined): from `$XDG_CACHE_HOME\google-cloud-tools-java\jib\` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME\Google\Jib\Cache\`
    - Windows (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` not defined): from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\google-cloud-tools-java\jib\` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Jib\Cache\`
    - Initial builds will be slower until the cache is repopulated, unless you manually move the cache from the old location to the new location

### Fixed

- `jibBuildTar` with `jib.container.format='OCI'` now builds a correctly formatted OCI archive. ([#2124](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2124))
- Now `jib.containerizingMode='packaged'` works as intended with Spring Boot projects that generate a fat JAR. ([#2178](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2178))
- Now automatically refreshes Docker registry authentication tokens when expired, fixing the issue that long-running builds may fail with "401 unauthorized." ([#691](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/691))

## 1.8.0

### Changed

- Requires Gradle 4.9 or newer (up from 4.6).
- Optimized building to a registry with local base images. ([#1913](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1913))

### Fixed

- Fixed reporting parent build file when `skaffold init` is run on multi-module projects. ([#2091](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2091))
- Now correctly uses the `war` task if it is enabled and the `bootWar` task is disabled for Spring WAR projects. ([#2096](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2096))
- `allowInsecureRegistries` and the `sendCredentialsOverHttp` system property are now effective for authentication service server connections. ([#2074](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2074))
- Fixed inefficient communications when interacting with insecure registries and servers (when `allowInsecureRegistries` is set). ([#946](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/946))

## 1.7.0

### Added

- `jib.outputPaths` object for configuration output file locations ([#1561](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1561))
  - `jib.outputPaths.tar` configures output path of `jibBuildTar` (`build/jib-image.tar` by default)
  - `jib.outputPaths.digest` configures the output path of the image digest (`build/jib-image.digest` by default)
  - `jib.outputPaths.imageId` configures output path of the image id  (`build/jib-image.id` by default)
- Main class inference support for Java 13/14. ([#2015](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2015))

### Changed

- Local base image layers are now processed in parallel, speeding up builds using large local base images. ([#1913](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1913))
- The base image manifest is no longer pulled from the registry if a digest is provided and the manifest is already cached. ([#1881](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1881))
- Docker daemon base images are now cached more effectively, speeding up builds using `docker://` base images. ([#1912](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1912))

### Fixed

- Fixed temporary directory cleanup during builds using local base images. ([#2016](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2016))
- Fixed additional tags being ignored when building to a tarball. ([#2043](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2043))
- Fixed `tar://` base image failing if tar does not contain explicit directory entries. ([#2067](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2067))

## 1.6.1

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with using custom base images in Java 12+ projects. ([#1995](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1995))

## 1.6.0

### Added

- Support for local base images by prefixing `jib.from.image` with `docker://` to build from a docker daemon image, or `tar://` to build from a tarball image. ([#1468](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1468), [#1905](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1905))

### Changed

- To disable parallel execution, the property `jib.serialize` should be used instead of `jibSerialize`. ([#1968](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1968))
- For retrieving credentials from Docker config (`~/.docker/config.json`), `credHelpers` now takes precedence over `credsStore`, followed by `auths`. ([#1958](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1958))
- The legacy `credsStore` no longer requires defining empty registry entries in `auths` to be used. This now means that if `credsStore` is defined, `auths` will be completely ignored. ([#1958](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1958))
- `jib.dockerClient` is now configurable on all tasks, not just `jibDockerBuild`. ([#1932](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1932))
- `jibDockerBuild.dockerClient` is deprecated in favor of `jib.dockerClient`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the regression of slow network operations introduced at 1.5.0. ([#1980](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1980))
- Fixed an issue where connection timeout sometimes fell back to attempting plain HTTP (non-HTTPS) requests when `allowInsecureRegistries` is set. ([#1949](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1949))

## 1.5.1

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue interacting with certain registries due to changes to URL handling in the underlying Apache HttpClient library. ([#1924](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1924))

## 1.5.0

### Added

- Can now set timestamps (last modified time) of the files in the built image with `jib.container.filesModificationTime`. The value should either be `EPOCH_PLUS_SECOND` to set the timestamps to Epoch + 1 second (default behavior), or an ISO 8601 date time parsable with [`DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html) such as `2019-07-15T10:15:30+09:00` or `2011-12-03T22:42:05Z`. ([#1818](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1818))
- Can now set container creation timestamp with `jib.container.creationTime`. The value should be `EPOCH`, `USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or an ISO 8601 date time. ([#1609](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1609))
- For Google Container Registry (gcr.io), Jib now tries [Google Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) (ADC) last when no credentials can be retrieved. ADC are available on many Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environments (such as Google Cloud Build, Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Google App Engine). Application Default Credentials can also be configured with `gcloud auth application-default login` locally or through the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. ([#1902](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1902))

### Changed

- When building to a registry, Jib now skips downloading and caching base image layers that already exist in the target registry. This feature will be particularly useful in CI/CD environments. However, if you want to force caching base image layers locally, set the system property `-Djib.alwaysCacheBaseImage=true`. ([#1840](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1840))
- `jib.container.useCurrentTimestamp` has been deprecated in favor of `jib.container.creationTime` with `USE_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. ([#1609](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1609))

## 1.4.0

### Added

- Can now containerize a JAR artifact instead of putting individual `.class` and resource files with `jib.containerizingMode = 'packaged'`. ([#1760](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1760/files))
- Now automatically supports WAR created by the Spring Boot Gradle Plugin via the `bootWar` task. ([#1786](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1786))
- Can now use `jib.from.image = 'scratch'` to use the scratch (empty) base image for builds. ([#1794](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1794/files))

### Changed

- Dependencies are now split into three layers: dependencies, snapshots dependencies, project dependencies. ([#1724](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1724))

### Fixed

- Re-enabled cross-repository blob mounts. ([#1793](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/1793))
- Manifest lists referenced directly by sha256 are automatically parsed and the first `linux/amd64` manifest is used. ([#1811](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1811))

## 1.3.0

### Changed

- Docker credentials (`~/.docker/config.json`) are now given priority over registry-based inferred credential helpers. ([#1704](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pulls/1704))

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with `jibBuildTar` where `UP-TO-DATE` checks were incorrect. ([#1757](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/1757))

## 1.2.0

### Added

# Contributing to Jib

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; 
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Building Jib

Jib comes as 3 components:

  - `jib-core`: a library
  - `jib-maven-plugin`: a Maven plugin that uses `jib-core`
  - `jib-gradle-plugin`: a Gradle plugin that uses `jib-core`

To build, use the provided `build.sh` which builds and tests each of the components into your local `~/.m2/repository`.  Note that this script does not run integration tests.

## Code Reviews

1. Set your git user.email property to the address used for step 1. E.g.
   ```
   git config --global user.email "janedoe@google.com"
   ```
   If you're a Googler or other corporate contributor,
   use your corporate email address here, not your personal address.
2. Fork the repository into your own Github account.
3. Please include unit tests (and integration tests if applicable) for all new code.
4. Make sure all existing tests pass (but see the note below about integration tests).
   * In `jib-core`, run `./gradlew clean goJF build integrationTest`
   * In `jib-gradle-plugin`, run `./gradlew clean goJF build integrationTest`
   * In `jib-maven-plugin`, run `./mvnw clean fmt:format verify -Pintegration-tests`
5. Associate the change with an existing issue or file a [new issue](../../issues).
6. Create a pull request!

**Note** that you will not be able to run the integration tests for `jib-gradle-plugin` or `jib-maven-plugin` because those push to our integration-testing GCP project. If you would like to run integration tests, change all uses of the `jib-integration-testing` project to your own GCP project and run `./gradlew integrationTest` for `jib-gradle-plugin` and `./mvnw verify -Pintegration-tests` for `jib-maven-plugin`.

# Development Tips

## Debugging the Jib Maven Plugin (`jib-maven-plugin`)

### Build and use a local snapshot 

To use a local build of the `jib-maven-plugin`:

  1. Build and install `jib-maven-plugin` into your local `~/.m2/repository`
     with `(cd jib-maven-plugin && ./mvnw install)`; this also builds `jib-core`.
     Alternatively, use the provided `build.sh` which performs an `install`.
  1. Modify your test project's `pom.xml` to reference the `-SNAPSHOT`
     version of the `com.google.cloud.tools.jib` plugin.

If developing from within Eclipse with M2Eclipse (the Maven tooling for Eclipse):

  1. Modify your test project's `pom.xml` to reference the `-SNAPSHOT`
     version of the `com.google.cloud.tools.jib` plugin.
  2. Create and launch a _Maven Build_ launch configuration for the
     test project, and ensure the _Resolve Workspace artifacts_ is checked.

### Attaching a debugger

Run `mvnDebug jib:build` and attach to port 8000.

If developing with Eclipse and M2Eclipse (the Maven tooling for Eclipse), just launch the _Maven Build_ with _Debug_.

## Debugging the Jib Gradle Plugin (`jib-gradle-plugin`)

### Build and use a local snapshot 

To use a local build of the `jib-gradle-plugin`:

  1. Build and install `jib-gradle-plugin` into your local `~/.m2/repository`
     with `(cd jib-gradle-plugin && ./gradlew build install)`; this also builds `jib-core`.
     Alternatively, use the provided `build.sh` which performs an `install`.
  1. Modify your test project's `build.gradle` to look like the following:
        ```groovy
        buildscript {
            repositories {
                mavenLocal() // resolve in ~/.m2/repository
                mavenCentral()
            }
            dependencies {
                classpath 'com.google.cloud.tools:jib-gradle-plugin:0.9.8-SNAPSHOT'
            }
        }

        plugins {
            // id 'com.google.cloud.tools.jib' version '0.9.7'
        }

        // Applies the java plugin after Jib to make sure it works in this order.
        apply plugin: 'com.google.cloud.tools.jib' // must explicitly apply local
        apply plugin: 'java'
        ```

### Attaching a debugger

Attach a debugger to a Gradle instance by running Gradle as follows:

```shell
./gradlew jib \
  --no-daemon \
  -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs='-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=5005,suspend=y'
```
